# Deep-Learning-Specialization
This repo contains all the lecture notes and programming assignments done by me from the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=17-DeepLearning-IN&utm_content=B2C&campaignid=6495527979&adgroupid=73202341370&device=c&keyword=deep%20learning%20specialization&matchtype=e&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=381790097712&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=Cj0KCQjwheyUBhD-ARIsAHJNM-OOp6SdniZ7ng746DEii5vcEBGZCXNem2LWOxmqB0LAIYDovzixXlUaAmrjEALw_wcB) by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). 

It includes various deep learning models which were implemented for Facial Recognition, Trigger Word Detection, Object Detection for Autonomous Driving, Neural Machine Translation, Image Segmentation with U-Net, Neural Style Transfer and LSTM.
